# Dataset Card for PeS2o

<!-- START-SHORT DESCRIPTION -->
A set of openly licensed scientific articles. 
<!-- END-SHORT DESCRIPTION -->

This dataset is a version of the peS2o dataset restricted to openly licensed articles. PeS2o is derived from S2ORC, a corpus of openly licensed abstract and full-text papers that have been converted to a structured format using Grobid. Starting from Grobidâ€™s XML output, peS2o filters papers that are too short, have incorrect metadata, are in languages other than English, and contain OCR errors using a combination of heuristic- and model-based filtering steps. Please refer to the peS2o datasheet and code for more details on the peS2o processing pipeline. For the openly licensed articles in this collection, per-document license information is available in the license entry of the metadata field of each example.

# Additional Information

## License Information
While we aim to produce datasets with completely accurate licensing information, license laundering and inaccurate metadata can cause us to erroneously assign the incorrect license to some documents (for further discussion of this limitation, please see our paper). If you believe you have found an instance of incorrect licensing in this dataset, please start a discussion on this repository.
