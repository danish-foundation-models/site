# Dataset Card for Data Provenance Initiative

<!-- START-SHORT DESCRIPTION -->
The Data Provenance Initiative is a digital library of supervised datasets that have been manually annotated with their source and license information.
<!-- END-SHORT DESCRIPTION -->

The Data Provenance Initiative is a digital library of supervised datasets that have been manually annotated with their source and license information [ 104, 107 ]. We leverage their tooling to filter HuggingFace datasets, based on a range of criteria, including their licenses. Specifically, we filter the data according to these criteria: contains English language or code data, the text is not model-generated, the datasetâ€™s audit yielded an open license, and the original sources of the data are only from recognized public domain sources. Per-document license information is available in the license entry of the metadata field of each example. Code for collecting, processing, and preparing this dataset is available in the common-pile GitHub repo.




## Dataset Description

<!-- START-DESC-STATS -->
- **Number of samples**: 3.51M
- **Number of tokens (Llama 3)**: 817.36M
- **Average document length in tokens (min, max)**: 232.97177537274933 (2, 275.30K)
<!-- END-DESC-STATS -->


## Dataset Structure
An entry in the dataset consists of the following fields:

- `id` (`str`): An unique identifier for each document.
- `text`(`str`): The content of the document.
- `source` (`str`): The source of the document.
- `added` (`str`): An date for when the document was added to this collection.
- `created` (`str`): An date range for when the document was originally created.
- `token_count` (`int`): The number of tokens in the sample computed using the Llama 8B tokenizer

# Additional Information

## License Information
While we aim to produce datasets with completely accurate licensing information, license laundering and inaccurate metadata can cause us to erroneously assign the incorrect license to some documents (for further discussion of this limitation, please see our paper). If you believe you have found an instance of incorrect licensing in this dataset, please start a discussion on this repository.
