# Dataset Card for Directory of Open Access Books

<!-- START-SHORT DESCRIPTION -->
The Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) is an online index of over 94,000 peer-reviewed books curated from trusted open-access publishers.
<!-- END-SHORT DESCRIPTION -->

The Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) is an online index of over 94,000 peer-reviewed books curated from trusted open-access publishers. To collect the openly licensed content from DOAB, we retrieve metadata using their official metadata feed. We then filter the collection to include only English-language books released under CC BY and CC BY-SA licenses. The filtered books are downloaded in PDF format and converted to plaintext using the Marker PDF-to-text converter. As an additional validation step, we manually create a whitelist of open license statements and retain only texts explicitly containing one of these statements in their front- or back-matter. Per-document license information is available in the license entry of the metadata field of each example. Code for collecting, processing, and preparing this dataset is available in the common-pile GitHub repo.

# Additional Information

## License Information
While we aim to produce datasets with completely accurate licensing information, license laundering and inaccurate metadata can cause us to erroneously assign the incorrect license to some documents (for further discussion of this limitation, please see our paper). If you believe you have found an instance of incorrect licensing in this dataset, please start a discussion on this repository.
