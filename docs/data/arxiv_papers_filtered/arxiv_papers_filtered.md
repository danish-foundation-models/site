# Dataset Card for ArXiv Papers

<!-- START-SHORT DESCRIPTION -->
Set of public domain papers, published on ArXiv.
<!-- END-SHORT DESCRIPTION -->

ArXiv is an online open-access repository of over 2.4 million scholarly papers covering fields such as computer science, mathematics, physics, quantitative biology, economics, and more. When uploading papers, authors can choose from a variety of licenses. This dataset includes text from all papers uploaded under CC BY, CC BY-SA, and CC0 licenses through a three-step pipeline: first, the latex source files for openly licensed papers were downloaded from ArXivâ€™s bulk-access S3 bucket; next, the LATEXML conversion tool was used to convert these source files into a single HTML document; finally, the HTML was converted to plaintext using the Trafilatura HTML-processing library. Code for collecting, processing, and preparing this dataset is available in the common-pile GitHub repo.




## Dataset Description

<!-- START-DESC-STATS -->
- **Number of samples**: 295.41K
- **Number of tokens (Llama 3)**: 6.11B
- **Average document length in tokens (min, max)**: 20.69K (3, 994.99K)
<!-- END-DESC-STATS -->


## Dataset Structure
An entry in the dataset consists of the following fields:

- `id` (`str`): An unique identifier for each document.
- `text`(`str`): The content of the document.
- `source` (`str`): The source of the document (see [Source Data](#source-data)).
- `added` (`str`): An date for when the document was added to this collection.
- `created` (`str`): An date range for when the document was originally created.
- `token_count` (`int`): The number of tokens in the sample computed using the Llama 8B tokenizer

# Additional Information

## License Information

While we aim to produce datasets with completely accurate licensing information, license laundering and inaccurate metadata can cause us to erroneously assign the incorrect license to some documents (for further discussion of this limitation, please see our paper). If you believe you have found an instance of incorrect licensing in this dataset, please start a discussion on this repository.
